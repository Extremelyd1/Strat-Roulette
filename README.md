# Strat Roulette
## A CS:GO Sourcemod Plugin

Every round has a twist (strategy) that the players must deal with.
For example:
* R8 only
* No-scope only
* Reverse controls
* One in the chamber
* Knife rounds
* And many more (over 60 strats)!

This plugin integrates with [PugSetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup) if it is loaded.

# Strat Roulette
## A CS:GO Sourcemod Plugin

**What is Strat Roulette?**  
Strat Roulette is a gamemode in which every round has a different mechanic applied. This ranges from using only certain weapons in a round to only being able to no-scope. It currently consists of **100+** strats! If you have ideas for new rounds, you can create an issue in the form of a Feature Request.

**How to install:**  
Make sure your server has [sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net) installed. You can find the install instructions for sourcemod on their website.
Download the [release](https://github.com/Extremelyd1/Strat-Roulette/releases/latest), unzip it and paste the contained csgo folder in your server installation. That's it!

**How to use:**  
There are a few commands that help with controlling the gamemode.
* /start - Starts the match
* /end - Ends the match
* /setround \[round number\] - Forcefully sets the next round strat
* /endround - Forcefully ends the round

Keep in mind that this plugin works best if there are no other plugins controlling the match in any other way. Except for [PugSetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup), as strat roulette nicely integrates with it.

**Maps:**
Strat Roulette works best on any of the following maps:
* de_lake
* de_safehouse
* de_stmarc
* de_bank
* de_rialto
* de_sugarcane

The reason this is mentioned, is that some of the more involved rounds only function on these maps, and will never be picked on other maps. Moreover, the game is a lot more fun with a single bombsite on more casual maps.

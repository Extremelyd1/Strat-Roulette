# Strat Roulette
## A CS:GO Sourcemod Plugin

**What is Strat Roulette?**  
Strat Roulette is a gamemode in which every round a different mechanic is applied. This ranges from using only certain weapons in a round to only being able to no-scope. It currently consists of more than 60 strats, with more to come! If you have ideas for new rounds, you can create an issue in the form of a Feature Request.

**How to install:**  
Download the release and paste the csgo folder in your server installation. That's it!

**How to use:**  
There are a few commands that help with controlling the gamemode.
* /start - Starts the match
* /end - Ends the match
* /setround \[round number\] - Forcefully sets the next round strat
* /endround - Forcefully ends the round

Keep in mind that this plugin works best if there are no other plugins controlling the match in any other way. Except for [PugSetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup), as strat roulette nicely integrates with it.
